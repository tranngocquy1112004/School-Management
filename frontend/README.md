# Frontend README

This frontend is bootstrapped with Create React App. To avoid duplication, the full setup instructions, scripts, and project usage are maintained in the root `README.md` at `../README.md`.

Quick commands:

- `cd frontend`
- `npm install`
- `npm start` (dev server at http://localhost:3000)
- `npm run build` (build production assets to `build/`)
